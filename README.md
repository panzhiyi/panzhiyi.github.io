## Getting Started

### Using with the GitHub Pages Service

- Fork this repository and change the name to `your-username.github.io.`
- Enable the GitHub pages for that repository following the steps [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-your-site).

### Using Locally with Jekyll

First, install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). The install instructions can be found here: <https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/#guides>

Install and run:

```bash
bundle install
bundle add webrick
bundle exec jekyll server
```

View the live page using `localhost`:
<http://localhost:4000>. You can get the HTML files in `_site` folder.


### Using the HTML version

The compiled HTML files are available in the `html_source_file` folder. If you don't like Jekyll, you may directly edit and use the HTML version.

## Customizing

### Configuration variables

The Minimal Light theme will respect the following variables, if set in your site's `_config.yml`:

  ```yaml
# Basic Information 
title: Your Name
position: Ph.D. Student
affiliation: Your Affiliation
email: yourname (at) example.edu

# Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
# The following information is used to improve the website traffic from search engines, e.g., Google.
keywords: ******
description: ******
canonical: https://your_domain/

# Links 
# If you don't need one of them, you may delete the corresponding line.
google_scholar: https://scholar.google.com/
cv_link: assets/files/curriculum_vitae.pdf
github_link: https://github.com/
linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/
twitter: https://twitter.com/

# Images (e.g., your profile picture and your website's favicon) 
# "favicon" and "favicon_dark" are used for the light and dark modes, respectively. 
avatar: ./assets/img/avatar.png
favicon: ./assets/img/favicon.png
favicon_dark: ./assets/img/favicon-dark.png

# Footnote
# You may use the option to disable the footnote, "Powered by Jekyll and Minimal Light theme."
enable_footnote: true

# Auto Dark Mode
# You may use the option to disable the automatic dark theme
auto_dark_mode: true

# Font
# You can use this option to choose between Serif or Sans Serif fonts.
font: "Serif" # or "Sans Serif"

# Google Analytics ID

google_analytics: UA-****
  ```
### Edit `index.md`

Create `index.md` and add your personal information. It supports **Markdown** and **HTML** syntax.

### Edit included files

There are two markdown files included in `index.md`. They are `_includes/publications.md` and `_includes/service.md`, respectively. These two files also support **Markdown** and **HTML** syntax. If you don't hope to include these two files, you may remove the following lines in `index.md`:
```
 {% include_relative _includes/publications.md %} 
  
 {% include_relative _includes/services.md %} 
```

If you hope to edit the publication list without changing the format, you may edit `_data/publications.yml`:
```
